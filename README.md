# YogaGuru-FlexMoney
Hello, I have created this beautiful project using the MERN stack as an internship assignment of Flexmoney. In this web app an user can register themselves for the yoga classes. I enjoyed while creating this project as I learned many new things while creating this project such as form validation, connecting the frontend to the backend and deploying the web app online.

My approach for this project was:-

<ol>
  <li>Create frontend of the admission form using html, css and reactjs.</li>
<li>Make the form responsive so that it does not get distorted in any device.</li>
<li>Create the backend of the form using nodejs, expressjs and mongoDB.</li>
<li>Do the basic validations as stated in the assignment.</li>
<li>Show a "Payment Successful" message when the user is registered.</li></ol>

The basic validations which I did in the project are specified in the problem statement.
This project can be used in the real world if I add a payment method which would accpet the payment either from the UPI or cards.
